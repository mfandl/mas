# mas

This is a project intended for learning [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and experiments with implementing multi-agent systems and agent-based models. No bright future, no clear structure and no stable API even considered at the moment.

The project started as a submission to [Bratislava Game Jam Session: Worldbuilding](https://session.bratislavagamejam.sk/).
